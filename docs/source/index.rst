A Python signal processing package for computing spectral- and time-domain interactions
using the bispectrum.

This package provides the tools for computing phase-amplitude coupling, time delay
estimation, and waveshape features using the bispectrum and bicoherence. Additional
tools for computing amplitude-amplitude coupling, phase-phase coupling, and
spatio-spectral filters are also provided.

Parallel processing and `Numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ optimisation are
implemented to reduce computation times.
