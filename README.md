A Python signal processing package for computing spectral- and time-domain interactions using the bispectrum.

This package provides the tools for computing phase-amplitude coupling, time delay estimation, and wave shape features using the bispectrum and bicoherence. Additional tools for computing amplitude-amplitude coupling, phase-phase coupling, and spatio-spectral filters are also provided.

Parallel processing and [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) optimisation are implemented to reduce computation times.

## Installation & Requirements:
Install the package into the desired environment using pip `pip install pybispectra`<br/>
More information on the [installation](https://pybispectra.readthedocs.io/en/main/installation.html) page.

## Use:
To get started with the toolbox, check out the [documentation](https://pybispectra.readthedocs.io/en/main/) and [examples](https://pybispectra.readthedocs.io/en/main/examples.html).

## Contributing & Development:
If you encounter issues with the package, want to suggest improvements, or have made any changes which you would like to see officially supported, please refer to the [development](https://pybispectra.readthedocs.io/en/main/development.html) page. A unit test suite is included and must be expanded where necessary to validate any changes.
