A Python signal processing package for computing spectral- and time-domain interactions using the bispectrum.

This package provides the tools for computing phase-amplitude coupling, time delay estimation, and wave shape features using the bispectrum and bicoherence. Additional tools for computing amplitude-amplitude coupling, phase-phase coupling, and spatio-spectral filters are also provided.

Parallel processing and [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) optimisation are implemented to reduce computation times.

## Installation & Requirements:
Install the package into the desired environment using pip `pip install pybispectra`<br/>
